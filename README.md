# Minecraft Server Plugin (for spigot)
It is called "BasicUtilities" but it does more.

## Features
* welcome message
* when you consume a mushroom stew, there is a small chance that a 
mooshroom cow will visit you
* [WIP] message delivery system: put a written book into a chest with title being the name of the 
recepient, then activate it with redstone. when the recepient comes online, a villager will deliver the 
message to them
* [WIP] water in buckets will have a chance of being innoculated with fungus. this means that after you 
place it, surrounding blocks may grow a bunch of flowers and edible plants. 
* other ideas?
